# PIZZA-CHAIN-RESTAURANT---POWER-BI-ANALYSIS
I created a dashboard for a pizza chain restaurant. The pizza chain has 5 branches in these locations: Ikoyi, Gbagada, Ibadan, Lekki and Surulere. The goal of preparing this dashboard was to use the visuals in Power Bi to highlight key financial metrics that would inform management decisions. My dashboard contains 3 sheets: Summary, Branch and Pizza.

## Summary Sheet:
For the summary sheet; I used card visuals to show the number of branches, total quantity of pizza sold and the total sales amount. From the visuals we can observe that approximately 15,000 pizzas were sold across the 5 branches adding up to a total sales amount of ₦ 47 million.

I used the gauge visual to compare the actual sales versus the target sales amount.
The next visual displayed on the summary sheet is clustered bar chart which I used to highlight the sales amount for those specific days versus the daily sales target for those days.

For the visual showing the Top selling branch and Best-selling pizza; I used clustered bar charts to highlight which branch brought in the highest revenue and which pizza sold the most across all branches. 
From the data provided; Ikoyi was the Top selling branch bringing in revenue of approximately  ₦ 9.8 million and the best-selling pizza was “Hot Pepperoni Feast” with total sales of ₦ 4.3 million.


## Branch Sheet:
The branch sheet I analyzed each branch, highlighting 3 key metrics:
* Quantity of pizza sold by the branch
* Total sales by the branch
* Top 3 selling pizza for the branch


## Pizza Sheet:
For the pizza sheet, I used a stacked column chart with small multiples showing sales for all pizzas across four branches (Ikoyi, Gbagada, Ibadan and Lekki).
